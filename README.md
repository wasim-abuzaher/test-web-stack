# Superformula Web Developer Test

Be sure to read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines within.

While this README assumes you implement both backend and frontend, only frontend context is required if you apply for Front-end position. To better showcase your skills and experience we encourage you to complete both "UI Context" and "Backend Context" parts depending on your time availability. In case you decide not to implement backend according to spec, feel free to implement mock api to accompany your frontend work.

## Backend Context

Build a GraphQL API that can `create/read/update` user data from a persistence store. Delete functionality is not required.

### User Model

```
{
  "id": "xxx",                  // user ID (must be unique)
  "name": "backend test",       // user name
  "dob": "",                    // date of birth
  "address": "",                // user address
  "description": "",            // user description
  "createdAt": ""               // user created date
  "updatedAt": ""               // user updated date
}
```

### Functionality

- The API should follow typical GraphQL API design pattern
- The data should be saved in the DB
- Proper error handling should be used
- Paginating and filtering (by name) users list

### Basic Requirements

  - Use **AWS AppSync (preferred)** or AWS Lambda + API Gateway approach
  - Use any AWS Database-as-a-Service persistence store. DynamoDB is preferred.
  - Write concise and clear commit messages
  - Write clear **documentation** on how it has been designed and how to run the code
  - Add a Query to fetch location information based off the user's address (use [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/) APIs); use AWS Lambda

### Bonus (in order)
  1. Use Infrastructure-as-code tooling that can be used to deploy all resources to an AWS account. Examples: CloudFormation / SAM, Terraform, Serverless Framework, etc.
  1. Provide proper unit tests
  1. Providing an online demo is welcomed, but not required
  1. Delete user functionality
  1. Bundle npm modules into your Lambdas

### Advanced Requirements

These may be used for further challenges. You can freely skip these; feel free to try out if you feel up to it.
  - Describe your strategy for Lambda error handling, retries, and DLQs
  - Describe your cloud-native logging, monitoring, and alarming strategy across all queries/mutations

## UI context

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (choose one of popular framework) to implement the following mock-up. You are only required to complete the desktop views, unless otherwise instructed. Application should connect to created GraphQL API.

## Requirements

### Functionality

- The search functionality should perform real time filtering on client side data and API side data
- List of users should be updated automatically after single user is updated
- Create modal from scratch - please don't use any library for it
- Appear/Disappear of modal should be animated (feel free with choose how)
- Infinite loading state should be saved in url query (pagination state should be present in URL query (eg ?page=1) to allow for behavior where the user can reload the page while still returning to their current scroll position)

### Tech stack

- JS oriented (Typescript preferred)
- Use **React**
- Use unsplash.com to show random avatar images
- You don't have to write configuration from scratch (you can use eg. CRA for React application)
- Feel free to use a preprocessor like SASS/SCSS/Less or CSS in JS
- Provide E2E and unit tests (one component&view well tested is enough, no need to test every component/view)
- Please **do not** use any additional libraries with predefined styles like `react-bootstrap`, `material-ui` etc.

### Bonus (in order)

1. Write clear **documentation** on how the app was designed and how to run the code
1. Providing an online demo is welcomed, but not required.
1. Provide a description of how you approach mobile friendly apps (what do you use, how)
1. Write concise and clear commit messages.
1. Provide components in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) with tests.
1. Include subtle animations to focus attention
1. Describe optimization opportunities when you conclude
1. Map with user location should update async - when user changes "location" field (feel free to choose MAPS service e.g. GoogleMaps, OpenStreetMap)
1. Handle server errors
1. Handle loading states
1. Delete user functionality

## What We Care About

Use any libraries that you would normally use if this were a real production App. Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature.

_We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result._

Here's what you should strive for:

- Good use of current HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js & performance best practices.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.

## Q&A
> Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. There is no deadline for this task unless otherwise noted to you directly.

> What if I have a question?

Create a new issue in this repo and we will respond and get back to you quickly.

> Should I validate inputs?

Please assume a hard requirement has not been set by the product owner. We welcome any input validations and your reasoning for why they add value.

> What is the location format?

Examples:
- Seattle, Washington
- Digital Nomad
- New Jersey
- Northern Bergen County, NJ

> I almost finished, but I don't have time to create everything what is required

Please provide a plan for the rest of the things that you would do.
